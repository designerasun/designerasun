Sometimes, a few web3 teams launching cool projects reach out to me for different reasons.

From job offers to testing to joining in a very early team member.

The best way to contact is my Gmail: nellow1102@gmail.com, which I regularly check. 

Depending on the busyness or business at the moment(yes, pun I intended), I might not reply but felt grateful.

Now, check my dev promo vid :) I think this promo vid shows my quality and personality pretty well.
